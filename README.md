# Project Overview

This project is designed to help you convert an pre made site to a mobile-ready site.

# How to use

Open an evergreen browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000. You will need to have a local server that must be listening on port 8000. Lucky for you this is already built in to the project. 
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
